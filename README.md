# Predicting Heart Disease utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms  

Heart disease and other cardiovascular illnesses continue to be a major global health concern, raising rates of morbidity and death. Using machine learning to address complicated medical issues has become increasingly important as we stand on the brink of technological progress. The goal of this project, "Predicting Heart Disease," is to provide an accurate and effective tool for estimating an individual's risk of developing heart disease by utilizing machine learning algorithms.  

**Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, K-NeighborsClassifier

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on Predicting Heart Disease using four different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Neighbors Classifier. The goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical features. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) where the algorithms are implemented, and the data is preprocessed, analyzed, and evaluated. The dataset used for this project, heart.csv, is downloaded from Kaggle and included in the repository. Additionally, a detailed PDF is provided, which contains descriptions and interpretations of all the generated graphs, charts, and results from the analysis, offering deeper insights into the model's performance and the conclusions drawn from the dataset.
